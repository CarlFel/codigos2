            Why do we bother with inline elements? There are certainly times we want to mark up content, but we don´t want to
            insert the line breaks around them. The <span> tag was the first to give you that ability, but it was mostly used to style 
            the code, and we don't want to do that. Some of the newer tags that still separate content and style are listed below.
            Remember, inline tags can flow next to other and don´t cause a line break before and after the element. We haveseen this with links and images.

        <div id = "Citing a source - cite">
            <h2>Citing a source - cite </h2>
            <p> The cite makes it much easier for people and bots to search the code for this specific information.
                A great reference for these and other elements is:
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer"> J.Robert Oppenheimer </a><br></li>
                    
                </ul>

            </div>

            <div id="abbr">
                <h2> Defining your abbreviations - abbr </h2>

                <p> The abbr will display an abbreviation on the browser. But if a title attribute is specified in the tag, the title will appear
                    when the mouse hovers over the abbreviation. Screen readers also provide the title information.
             </p>
             <p>The days of the week are often abbreviation: Sun, Mon, Tues, etc.</p>
            

            </div>

            <div id = "time">
                <h2> Specifying the use of time - time</h2>

                <p>The time is again a completely semantic tag that can be used to search for specific information.  </p>
                    
                <p> This party starts at 9:00pm.</p>
                <p>The party took place on New Year's Eve.</p>
            </div>

            <div id ="Code">
                <h2> Identifying code fragments - code</h2>

                <p> The code elements tends to be displayed in a different font, but also has the semantic meaning to convey information to as many people as 
                    possible
                </p>

                <p> I have been trying to learn how to write html to write html but my img elements never seem to work</p>


            </div>

            <div id=" sub and sup">
                <h2> Using subscripts and superscripts sub and sup</h2>

                <p>THe sub and sup elements are used to create the super and subscripts, e.g (x+y)^{3} or H_20. In the past, people would often paste mathematical images into the page.
                    But images didn't convet the same meaning to all users.

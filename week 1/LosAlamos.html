            <h2> Absolute References </h2>
            <p> Absolute references (sometimes called external links) connect to pages in other domains. In the href attribute of the tag 
                the full URL of the page, image, or other resource you would like to link to is specified. one example might be you quest
                to list the scientist involved in Los Alamos creating the Atomic Bomb.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer"> J.Robert Oppenheimer </a><br></li>
                    <li><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Fuchs"> Klaus Fuchs  </a><br></li>
                    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe"> Hans Bethe  </a><br></li>
                </ul>
            <p> An advantage of absolute references is that you always linked to the most up-to-date information on that page. 
                A disadvantage is that it is up to you to make sure that the links don't change.

                <h2> Relative References </h2>

                <p> Relative references (sometimes called internal links) connect to pages in other domains. In the href attribute of the tag
                    only the folder (if any) and filename is specified. Some examples of when you might user relative references would be in your navigation bar
                or links to your images.

            <div id = "Images">
                <h2> Image as links</h2>

                <p>More and more people are mpving away from textual prompts to ones that are graphics based.
                    This is because the page looks "nicer". I can redo the link above using a picture insted of words. <br>
                    
                    <a href="/Users/ch-mango/Desktop/FISICA UV/Web Design, University of Michigan/week 1/klaus_Fuchs.jpg">
                        <img src="/Users/ch-mango/Desktop/FISICA UV/Web Design, University of Michigan/week 1/klaus_Fuchs.jpg" alt ="Klaus Fuchs">
                        </a><br>
                </p>
                <p> Something to keep in mind though, is that not everyone can see the image, or they may not realize that the image is a link. 
                    As you become more confident in your coding you will want to make sure to have many people test your pages so that you can make it an optimal
                    experience for as many people as possible. </p>
